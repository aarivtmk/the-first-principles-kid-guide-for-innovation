Step by step guide to learn programming.

Hi, this is Aariv. So learning programming is a slow process and here are the things you need.

1. Kid like excitement to learn
2. Patience
3. Practice
4. Interaction with people who are already practicing.

So how to learn?
1. Solve basic arithmetic problems like additions, subtractions, divisions and multiplications
2. rounding a number, symbol,digit,placevalue,facevalue, immediate right number, immediate left number, GEMDAS (precedence and associativity), implied multiplication, properties of numbers,  factors, squaring, prime number series, decimals, fractions, proper fraciton, imporoper fraciton, multiplying factors, percentages, 
 
3. Solve basic aptitude
4 . Learn programming basic theory like 
how does a computer work
behind the scenes of program execution
comments,
variables,
datatype/primitive
operators- logical, comparitive, arithmetic, unary, terenary operators
rules of variables,
conditional statements: if,ifelse,elseif ladder,
jumping statements: break and continue,
loops: for,while and do while 
funcitons,formal paramenters, actual paraments, 
variable mutation
pointers concept
arrays
dictionaries
object and class.
properties of object oriented language,

Now start with c programming.
